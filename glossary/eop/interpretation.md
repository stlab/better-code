> A [[value type]] is a correspondence between a species ([[abstract species|abstract]] or [[concrete species|concrete]]) and a set of [[datum|datums]]. A datum corresponding to a particular entity is called a [[representation]] of the entity; the entity is called the [[interpretation]] of the datum. We refer to datum together with its interpretation as a [[value]].
