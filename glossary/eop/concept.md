A collection of requirements on a type, expressed as syntactic, semantic, and complexity properties. 

More formally, a description of requirements on one or more types stated in terms of the existence and properties of [[procedure|procedures]], [[type attribute|type attributes]], and [[type function|type functions]] defined on the types.

We say a concept is _modeled_ by specific types, or that the types _model_ the concept, if the requirements are satisfied for these types. 

A program remains correct if a type is replaced by a different type with the same properties; that is, with a type which models the same concept(s).
