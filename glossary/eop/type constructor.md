A mechanism for creating a new type from one or more existing types. 

# Examples

- `pointer(T)` is the built-in type constructor that takes a type `T` and returns the type "pointer to `T`"
- `struct` is the built-in `n-ary` type constructor; a structure template is a user-defined `n-ary` type constructor.
