A type which has a [[computational basis]] including:
- [[equality]], 
- [[assignment]], 
- [[destructor]], 
- [[default constructor|default]] [[constructor]], 
- copy constructor, 
- total ordering, 
- and underlying type

We call types having such a basis regular, since their use guarantees regularity of behavior, and therefore, interoperability. 

We derive the semantics of regular types from built-in types, such as `bool`, `int`, and when restricted to well-formed values, `double`.
