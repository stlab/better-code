# Style guide

- The first line of a definition should be a sentence fragment that defines the term, similar to Swift documentation.
- Hyperlink only the first use of a term.
- When an example presented is a counterexample, bold the use of the word **not**. 
- When a phrase is used as a term, but does not yet have a sufficiently standalone definition to merit its own page, refer to it in _italics_.
- When a word can be used to describe different ideas in different contexts, number the definitions, and nest the elaborations below. See [[uniquely represented]]. Do not number the definitions if there is only one definition.
