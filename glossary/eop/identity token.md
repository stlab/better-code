A unique value expressing the [[identity]] of an [[object]] and is computed from the value of the object and the [[address]] of its resources.

Testing equality of identity tokens corresponds to testing identity. During the lifetime of an application, a particular object could use different identity tokens as it moves either within a data structure or from one data structure to another.

# Examples

- The address of the object
- An index into an array where the object is stored
- An employee number in a personnel record
